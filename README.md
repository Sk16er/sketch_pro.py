## 📸 Sketch Pro — Auto Image Capture & Sketch Drawing with Turtle

Welcome to **Sketch Pro** — a Python-based project that uses your webcam to **capture images**, convert them into **pencil sketches**, and draw them using **Turtle graphics**! All done **automatically** with real-time **Windows notifications**.

## 📦 **Libraries to Install**

Make sure to install these Python libraries before running the program:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install plyer
pip install turtle open-cv wheel sketchpy
```

---

## 🖥 **How It Works**

1. **Run the Python script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Live webcam feed** will open.

3. **Press `Space bar`** to:
   - Capture an image.
   - Auto-generate a sketch from the image.
   - See a Windows notification for file save locations.
   - Automatically start Turtle drawing of the sketch.
   - Resume live webcam feed for next capture!

4. **Press `ESC`** to exit the application anytime.

## 📂 **File Naming & Saving Logic**

- Captured images are saved as:
  ```
  captured_image1.jpg, captured_image2.jpg, captured_image3.jpg, ...
  ```

- Sketches are saved as:
  ```
  sketch_image1.jpg, sketch_image2.jpg, sketch_image3.jpg, ...
  ```

- **No overwrite guarantee**: If previous files exist, numbering will **continue automatically** from the last file.

---

## 🔔 **Windows Notifications**

After every action:
- **Image captured** notification with file path.
- **Sketch created** notification with file path.

Example:
```
📸 Image Captured
Saved at: C:/Users/YourName/Path/captured_image3.jpg

🎨 Sketch Created
Saved at: C:/Users/YourName/Path/sketch_image3.jpg
```
